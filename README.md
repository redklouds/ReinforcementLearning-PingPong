# ReinforcementLearning-PingPong

In this project I combine my knowledge of Neural Networks and data mining to learn about how reinforcement learning works, The current sources are an tutorial example using a Multi-layer perceptron with 200 Neurons in the first layer and a single neuron as a probablity output layer, this probability is computed using the ReLu and LogSig transfer functions. Combined with this network I will be using openAI Gym (Check them out!) as my training enviroment.
